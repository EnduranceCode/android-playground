# Google Developer Scholarship

The folder [`google-developer-scholarship`](../google-developer-scholarship/) contains the code developed while studying with  the [Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship](https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017) that was offered by [Udacity](https://udacity.com) and sponsored by [Google](https://www.google.com/about/).

The [Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship](https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017) program was divided into two phases:

1. **Challenge phase**: 60,000 recipients participated in this initial phase to learn Android development basics.
2. **Nanodegree phase**: The top 6,000 performers from the first phase were selected to complete a full [Nanodegree program](https://developer.android.com/).

The code developed on the Challenge phase of the program is stored on the folder [`basics-challenge`](./basics-challenge/) and the code developed during the full [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/school/programming) phase of the [Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship](https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017) is stored in the folder [`basics-nanodegree`](./basics-nanodegree/).
