# Project 4 - Music Player App

This branch of the [Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship](https://github.com/EnduranceCode/GoogleDeveloperNanodegreeScholarship/tree/master) contains the code for the fourth project of the [Android Basics Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship](https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017).

## Project Overview
The goal is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app. For this project, **the app does not actually needs to play music**.

Data about each song should be stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.

### Attributions
The app's launcher icon is based in the *headset* icon from [Google Material Design hardware icons set](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).
